Deleting new session causes weird local state confusion with 0th session.

Width of elements on mobile section

Add input items for each activity

add rounds to data list

Add notes to bottom of session to allow saving

How difficult the session is? 1 to 10 on how hard they found it. Easy to hard specified.

Saving to database eractically - not only on save in admin.

Tracking of data for each card - but to be able to change the user data to track if amount is changed.

Way of seeing previous data or sessions that people have done - link or display to previous section (last time)

Responsive 700px change to 1200px doesn't work.

Add user data into overall plan.

Title inside box.
